# React Revolut Clone

This React project aims to replicate the structure and features of the Revolut website through the use of components for a dynamic and responsive user interface. The primary goal is to provide practical experience in React development by slicing and recreating various sections of the chosen webpage.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the project [here](https://splendid-raindrop-e72f2c.netlify.app/).

## Overview

The project focuses on dissecting the chosen webpage and breaking it down into reusable components. Each component encapsulates a specific section of the webpage, such as navigation bars, card displays, transaction panels, etc. By modularizing the code in this manner, we ensure better maintainability, scalability, and reusability throughout the project.

## Features

- **Dynamic UI:** Utilizing React's component-based architecture, the project offers a dynamic and responsive user interface that closely mimics the original webpage's behavior.
- **Replicated Structure:** By slicing the existing webpage, it replicates its structure and layout.
- **Code Modularity:** Components are organized in a modular fashion, enabling easy maintenance and future enhancements. Each component focuses on a specific functionality or section of the webpage.
- **Responsive Design:** The project is designed to be responsive across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience regardless of the platform.



## Usage
